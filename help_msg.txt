Welcome to this lexer and parser for interpretting inter-language notes.
This program aims to address the issue of freely written notes being
interpretable by other systems.
Thus, the lexer and parser present here can parse notes with very
little syntax contrains so that you can make notes freely.

    Idea: input file with notes, output file with parsed notes as JSON

    Syntax:
        ~ for comments. Comments will be stored and used for context
	during quizzes.
        # for Hard comments. These will be completely ignored.
        , or / to delimit synonyms
        == to assert equivalence
        1)spaces between words will be stored as is
        2) spaces between words and special chars will be ommited.

    Usage:
        python <python_file> <file_read> [<file_write>] lang1 lang2
		trailing words will be omitted
        Note: if <file_write> isn't given, the file_read with a .json 
		extention will be used to write onto.
